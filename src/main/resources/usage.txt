● Everything following is going about item section:

● HOW TO SET MATERIAL?
  ● Material fields:
      - skull: 'here should be the name of minecraft premium player'
      - head: 'here should be custom minecraft head (for instance, you can find something here: https://minecraft-heads.com/)'
      - material: READ TUTORIAL BELOW.
  ● My minecraft server version is 1.12 or below:
      Format - material: <material>:<value>
      Example - material: WOOL:14
      Example link with IDs: https://minecraft-ids.grahamedgecombe.com/
  ● My minecraft server version is 1.13 or above:
      Format - material: <material>
      Example - material: RED_WOOL
      Example link with IDs: https://www.digminecraft.com/lists/item_id_list_pc_1_13.php
  ● NOTE: Material must be typed with CAPS.

● HOW TO MAKE INVISIBLE ITEM?
  If you want to make invisible item, use "blank: true", otherwise use "blank: false".
  Default value is "false", that's why item will be visible by default.

● HOW TO SET CUSTOM MODEL DATA?
  Use - CustomModelData: <number>
  For instance - CustomModelData: 1
